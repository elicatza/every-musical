# Listening to every broadway musical
This repo will have tools to download all musicals.
I would also like to store my ratings here.
Maybe I'll learn htmx, so that I can make an amazing tierlist.

I hope this will serve a usefull tool for finding new musicals.
To ensure so, I'll include favorite song and lyric for each musical
aswell as a short written review.

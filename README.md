# Listening to every broadway musical

This repo will have tools to download all musicals. I would also like to store
my ratings here. Maybe I'll learn htmx, so that I can make an amazing tier
list.

I hope this will serve as useful tool for finding new musicals. To ensure so,
I'll include favorite song and lyric for each musical as well as a short
written review.

# Listening to every broadway musical
This repo will have tools to download all musicals.
I would also like to store my ratings here.
Maybe I'll learn htmx, so that I can make an amazing tierlist.

## Steps
1. Download a list of all broadway musicals.
2. Prase data into title, release date, synopsis, authors, and links.
3. Manually parse websites (youtube + others), to find recordings (Oh joy).
4. Make a tool to downloads recordings.
5. Listening to them.
6. Rating + I want to write down thoughts.

I don't know how accurate it is, but it was the most racist and sexist thing I had ever seen at the time, quite impressive actually. An amazing accomplishment. The music is Ivring Berlin, which means it's not too bland, but it sounds really old. My favorite part is Ethel Merman, and the other actors. They've got great joke delivery. That's a plus.

It has had 4 Broadway revivals, the newest one in 2009. My hopes are sky high. Rainbow High that is. The plot thickens. The white senator turns black because of someones wish. Lovely, just swell. He wishes himself white but genius writing happens: 'Og decides what the Senator needs is a new inside rather than a new outside.' -Wikipedia. It's actually good, wtf: 'The Senator tries to defend Woody and Sharon, but as a black man he lacks any authority over the Sheriff'. More from wiki: 'Og wishes the Senator white again. The Senator promises to be a better representative to the people'. I assume they did black face in the original, but I thought it would be way worse. I did not expect an anti-racism and pro-racism musical yet. Now to other aspect of the musical. I've begun a school production of the musical. Some of the characters are likable and the songs are the reason for that. This is actually a fairly decent musical I give it a B for now.

I am also not the fondest of the incest village idea. The village is hidden from the world except 1 day every 100 years. It's not novel nor does it enhance the plot. Act II is not much better. It's the love is more powerful than the rules we have learned about, so what should have been a tragedy turns into a happy ending by love. Thanks I hate it. The music ameliorates my boredom. And I can bearly understand what they are singing about. At least it's not an opera. I've read the reviews and it's highly praised for it's dancing (I can't hear any) and music.
